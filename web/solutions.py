"""
Shared solution content for the homepage, the solutions page and the
solution detail pages.

Data contract
-------------
SOLUTIONS is a list of seven dicts, in display order. Each has:
    number, slug, title, description, detail, features (3),
    eyebrow, image, image_alt, headline, intro (2 paragraphs),
    outcomes (3 {title, text}), capabilities (6 {title, text}),
    process (4 {step, title, text}), related_case_studies (real slugs
    from web.case_studies), faqs (3 {q, a}).

FEATURES is the homepage carousel: one slide per solution, same order,
each {category, title, description, slug, image, alt}. Category, image and
alt are taken from the matching solution so the two never drift apart.

Keep every number, slug and title stable: URLs depend on them. Do not add
client names, metrics or claims that are not backed by a real project.
